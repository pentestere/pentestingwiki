<h1>Rule based cracking hashcat</h1>

example:
{% highlight bash%} 
hashcat -m 5600 /home/user1/hash.txt /home/user1/wordlist.txt --rules=/opt/hashcat/rules/best64.rule -O -w 3
{% endhighlight %}

Recommended order for efficient rule based cracking:
1 - best64.rule
2 - InsidePro-PasswordsPro.rule
3 - rockyou-30000.rule
If all else fails try the very extensive dive.rule (this will take a long time).
Always make sure you have a good wordlist to go along with these rules. rockyou.txt is usually a good starting place.
